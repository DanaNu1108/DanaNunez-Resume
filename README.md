Welcome to my resume repository. I'm a data analyst with a background in industrial engineering, procurement, and process optimization. Currently completing a Data Science diploma in Canada, I’ve developed strong technical skills in Python, SQL, Tableau, and machine learning through hands-on projects.

I enjoy combining technical insight with real-world business understanding to solve problems and improve processes.
